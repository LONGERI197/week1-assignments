<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My background education is in BSc Range Management and having worked under the Index-Based Livestock Insurance in Northern Kenya as an intern where I trained over 20 subagents and got over 500 new customers during my 3 months internship. I have built a strong network with farmers, agriculture professionals, and conservationists. My pride is connecting farmers to the market, linking them with agriculture professions. I covered training on Gooseberry that had a great engagement with most followers starting the venture.
    To enhance my skills, I have trained with the World Wildlife Fund (2021), on strategies for NGO’S, Design Thinking, Social Value Proposition, and Fundraising and African Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES) on Climate Leadership Program that is very fundamental in food security and the role

I believe am also ambitious. I joined the Software Engineering class to learn more on the subject as I aspire to create my ‘Farm with Bisase’ website and app. I hope to grow in the sector and be a contributor in Safaricom’s Technology Department. Am excited about the journey.</p>
